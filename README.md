# Digital Innovation Agents

> **AI-Powered Software Development Workflow** - From idea to production-ready code through structured, quality-gated phases.

A comprehensive system of specialized AI agents that guide software development from initial business concept through requirements engineering, architecture design, implementation, and debugging. Built for GitHub Copilot with automated quality gates and validation.

---

## 🎯 What This Is

**Digital Innovation Agents** transforms how software is built by providing a structured, agent-based workflow that ensures quality at every stage. Instead of jumping straight into code, projects follow a systematic path:

```
Business Idea → Requirements → Architecture → Implementation → Quality Assurance
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓                ↓
   BA Agent    RE Agent    Architect Agent  Developer Agent  Debugger Agent
```

Each agent specializes in one phase, has built-in quality checks, and produces standardized outputs that feed into the next phase.

## 🤖 The Five Agents

### 1. **Business Analyst** (`@business-analyst`)
**Role:** Transform raw ideas into structured business requirements

**When to use:**
- Starting a new project from scratch
- Have a problem but unclear on the solution
- Need to explore requirements systematically

**Input:** Raw project idea or problem description  
**Output:** `docs/business-analysis/BA-[PROJECT].md`

**Key Features:**
- Scope detection (Simple Test / PoC / MVP)
- Structured interviews (5-50 questions based on scope)
- Jobs-to-be-Done analysis
- Value proposition development
- Success metrics definition

---

### 2. **Requirements Engineer** (`@requirements-engineer`)
**Role:** Convert business analysis into architect-ready requirements

**When to use:**
- Have a business analysis document
- Need structured epics and features
- Ready to define technical requirements

**Input:** Business Analysis document OR direct user input  
**Output:**
- `requirements/epics/EPIC-*.md`

---

### 3. **Architect** (`@architect`)
**Role:** Design technical architecture and create developer-ready issues

**Input:** Issues from `backlog/ISSUE-*.md`  
**Output:**
- Production code (`src/**/*`)
- Test code (`tests/**/*`)

**Key Features:**
- **5-Phase Streamlined Workflow:**
  1. Task Analysis & Setup
  2. Implementation (code + tests)
  3. Testing & Validation (ALL tests MANDATORY)
  4. Validation & Commit
  5. Completion & Metrics

**Quality Gate 3 (QG3):**
- ✅ ALL tests written (from task test plan)
- ✅ ALL tests executed (full suite)
- ✅ ALL tests passing OR error log created

## 🎯 Key Principles

### 1. **Adaptive Complexity**
Architecture depth matches project scope:
- **Simple Test:** Minimal (hours-days)
- **PoC:** Focused (1-4 weeks)
- **MVP:** Comprehensive (2-6 months)

### 2. **Quality Gates**
No phase proceeds until quality criteria met:
- **QG1:** Requirements ready for architecture
- **QG2:** Architecture ready for development
- **QG3:** Code ready for production
- **QGD:** Bugs fixed without regressions

### 3. **Test-First Development**
- Write tests AS you code (not after)
- Execute ALL tests (not just affected)
- 100% pass rate OR error log created
- Coverage ≥90% maintained

### 4. **Clean Separation**
- **BA:** WHAT problem (business view)
- **RE:** WHAT to build (requirements view)
- **Architect:** HOW to structure (architectural view)
- **Developer:** HOW to implement (code view)
- **Debugger:** WHY it failed (root cause view)

### 5. **Atomic Work Units**
- Issues are small (1-3 days max)
- Single responsibility per issue
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Independent and testable

---

## 📊 Quality Standards

### Requirements Engineering
- ✅ All NFRs quantified (no vague "fast" or "secure")
- ✅ All ASRs identified and marked (🔴 Critical / 🟡 Moderate)
- ✅ Acceptance criteria testable (pass/fail)
- ✅ Traceability to business goals

### Architecture
- ✅ ADRs in MADR format (3+ options, pros/cons, research links)
- ✅ arc42 complete for scope (Simple Test: skip, PoC: 1,3,4, MVP: 1-7)
- ✅ Issues atomic (1-3 days each)
- ✅ Backlog.md as single source of truth

### Development
- ✅ Tests written during implementation
- ✅ ALL tests executed (full suite)
- ✅ Clean code (type hints, docstrings, no TODOs)
- ✅ Coverage ≥90%

### Debugging
- ✅ Root cause identified (not symptom)
- ✅ Clean fix (no workarounds)
- ✅ Comprehensive testing (no regressions)
- ✅ Learnings documented

## 🔧 Configuration

### Enable Agents in Your Project

1. **Copy the `.github/` directory** to your project root

2. **Customize chatmodes** (optional):
   - Edit `.github/chatmodes/*.chatmode.md` for your needs
   - Adjust complexity levels
   - Add/remove tools

3. **Use in GitHub Copilot Chat:**
   ```
   @business-analyst [your request]
   @requirements-engineer [your request]
   @architect [your request]
   @developer [your request]
   @debugger [your request]
   ```

### Agent Selection in Copilot

GitHub Copilot automatically detects available agents from `.github/chatmodes/` and presents them in the agent picker.

## 🎓 Best Practices

### When to Use Which Agent

**Use @business-analyst when:**
- ❓ Starting with a vague idea
- 🆕 New project from scratch
- 🤔 Need to explore problem space

**Use @requirements-engineer when:**
- 📄 Have business analysis document
- ✍️ Have clear requirements but need structure
- 🎯 Want to skip discovery and jump to features

**Use @architect when:**
- 🏗️ Requirements complete (QG1 passed)
- 📋 Need technical design decisions
- 🔧 Ready to plan implementation

**Use @developer when:**
- 💻 Architecture complete (QG2 passed)
- 📝 Have developer-ready issues
- 🧪 Ready to implement with tests

**Use @debugger when:**
- 🐛 Tests failing
- 📋 Have error log from Developer
- 🔍 Need systematic root cause analysis

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **DON'T:**
- Skip quality gates (they catch problems early!)
- Write code without tests
- Use vague NFRs ("fast", "secure")
- Create oversized issues (>3 days)
- Commit with failing tests

✅ **DO:**
- Follow the workflow sequentially
- Let each agent do its job
- Quantify all NFRs with numbers
- Keep issues atomic (1-3 days)
- Run ALL tests before commit
